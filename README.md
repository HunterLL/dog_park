# Dog Park Data Dashboard Project  
The Dog Park Data Dashboard is a Python-based project developed for the CS 5001 course. This project aims to analyze and visualize the distribution of dog off-leash parks in different neighborhoods of the city of Vancouver. The project involves parsing data from CSV files, performing data analysis, creating visualizations, and enabling user interaction.  

## Project Overview  
The Dog Park Data Dashboard project is divided into two milestones, each with specific goals and requirements.  

## Milestone 1  
In the first milestone, the focus is on designing the project and implementing the core "Model" portion. This includes importing data from CSV files, cleaning and parsing the data, performing analysis, and printing the results. The project aims to achieve the following objectives:  

- Import at least 2 .csv files from the web using the requests module.
- Clean the data and parse it into objects.
- Analyze the data to calculate the percentage of dog off-leash parks in each neighborhood.
- Store analysis results in an appropriate data structure.
- Print the analysis results.  

## Milestone 2  
The second milestone builds upon the work of Milestone 1 and focuses on adding interactivity and visualization. This involves creating a "Controller" part for user interaction and a "View" part for data visualization. The goals of Milestone 2 are as follows:   

- Enhance the driver to take user input either through a GUI or the terminal.
- Generate visualizations, typically in the form of bar charts, based on user input.
- Develop a non-interactive, non-GUI test suite for the model portion of the program.

## Data Sets and Analysis  
The project uses two datasets: "parks" and "dog off-leash parks," which provide information about parks and dog off-leash areas in Vancouver neighborhoods. The primary analysis involves calculating the percentage of dog off-leash parks among all parks in each neighborhood.
